Testing the Speed of Your Server

</h1>
If you require a **speedtest.net** sort of test, unfortunately this cannot be achieved as the servers lack a GUI and thus a web browser which you could run on your server to test speeds.  
  
**Important note:** Feral are aware of the python speed test tools. It is not used due to being buggy and inaccurate.

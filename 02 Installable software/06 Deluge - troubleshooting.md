Deluge - troubleshooting
========================

  
**Important note:** If you are on the server `eros` and your deluge does not load properly it is most likely being blocked by an ad blocker. You will need to white list the URL:  
  

    eros.feralhosting.com

  
**Important Note:** If you have just installed Deluge for the first time on your slot and get a "502 Bad Gateway" when loading the web interface, please reload the page in a few minutes and it should work. If it never loads you can restart the installation process via the software installation page for your slot and that should resolve the issue. IfÂ  the issue persists please [open a ticket](https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/tickets/new)  
  
If you do have problems it can be restarted by following these instructions: [Restarting - rtorrent - Deluge - Transmission - MySQL](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=158)  
  
The thin client allows you to control it remotely from your desktop as if you were running it locally: [Deluge Daemon - Remote control with the local Thin client](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=76)  
  
The thin client is a necessity if you run a lot of torrents in the client where the web ui just won't work. If you run into this you will see the error "connection to webserver has been lost!" a lot. The thin client also allows you to create torrents and use the plugins that come with Deluge.

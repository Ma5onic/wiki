Deluge Daemon - Remote control with the local Thin client
=========================================================

  
This FAQ requires you have already installed Deluge using the [\[b\]Install Software\[/b\] link in your Manager](https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/) link in the manager for your slot.  
  
In SSH do these commands. Use this FAQ if you do not know how to SSH into your slot: [SSH basics - Putty](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12)  
  
To be able to connect your local deluge client to your remote daemon and interact with it as if it were running locally is easy and just takes a few steps.  
  

Bash Script:
------------

  
This bash script will do the following things for you.:  
  
**1:** Print your hostname and daemon port  
**2:** Print your username and password  
  
You will then be able to connect to deluge using the thin client with the information printed by the script.  
  

    wget -qO ~/delugethin.sh http://git.io/obe0mA && bash ~/delugethin.sh

Manual Installation Steps:
--------------------------

  
You need to know some settings and passwords on the server first. To do this, [SSH](http://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12) into your Feral slot and execute the following commands:  
  
**1:** Get your connection details.  
  
Copy and paste this one liner to retrieve all the required info in a single copy and paste command:  
  

    printf "$(hostname -f)\n$(whoami)\n$(sed -rn 's/(.*)"daemon_port": (.*),/\2/p' ~/.config/deluge/core.conf)\n$(sed -rn "s/$(whoami):(.*):(.*)/\1/p" ~/.config/deluge/auth)\n"

  
Here are the individual components of the one liner command:  
  
Your hostname:  
  

    hostname -f

  
Your username:  
  

    whoami

  
Your connection port:  
  

    sed -rn 's/(.*)"daemon_port": (.*),/\2/p' ~/.config/deluge/core.conf

  
This is the password you will need to connect the thin client to the remote daemon.  
  

    sed -rn "s/$(whoami):(.*):(.*)/\1/p" ~/.config/deluge/auth

  
**Step 2:** Local Client (Thin Client) Set-up  
  
Download [deluge](http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download) (make sure the version matches the daemon version running on the server).  
  
Install and run deluge on your local machine and then run it.  
  
Go to `Preferences -> Interface` and un-check`Enable` under `Classic Mode`.  
  
You should now see a connection manager box pop up.  
  
Remove the localhost daemon  
  
Click `Add` and enter the address of your Feral server, for example: `athena.feralhosting.com` found from the commands in **Step 1**.  
  
Set the port to the port you got in **Step 1**.  
  
Enter the username and password you got from **Step 1**.  
  
Click `Add` to add your server's daemon â€” you should now see a green icon as the status for the host you just added. \#  
  
If the light stays red, remove the connection start again.  
  
**Optional:**  
  
Expand `Options` and select `Automatically connect to selected host on startup` and `Do not show this dialogue on start-up`  
Click `Connect`, and the connection manager pop up box should disappear. You should find deluge is now functioning as a local client while manipulating the remote deluge daemon on your Feral slot

Owncloud Manual installation
----------------------------

  
In [SSH](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12) run this command. It will download the `setup.php` to the root of your `WWW`  
  

    wget -P ~/www/$(whoami).$(hostname -f)/public_html/ https://download.owncloud.com/download/community/setup-owncloud.php

  
Now visit the URL in this format, in your browser, it will look something like this:  
  
**Important note:** If you use or force https you may need to unblock the remote content of the installer in Firefox.

nginx
-----

  
**Important note:** This configuration depends on the user installing owncloud to the default location which is the subdirectory `/owncloud` inside the `public_html` folder.  
  
**Owncloud custom conf:**  
  
Now download a preconfigured conf file to use in conjunction with this edit:  
  

    wget -qO ~/.nginx/conf.d/000-default-server.d/owncloud.conf http://git.io/nVy4Cg

  
Now run this command in SSH:  
  
**Important note:** You need to run this command at least once to properly configure the `owncloud.conf`  
  

    sed -ri "s|fastcgi_pass(.*);|fastcgi_pass    unix:$HOME/.nginx/php/socket;|g" ~/.nginx/conf.d/000-default-server.d/owncloud.conf

  
Now reload nginx:  
  

    /usr/sbin/nginx -s reload -c ~/.nginx/nginx.conf

  
Owncloud should now work as intended with nginx.

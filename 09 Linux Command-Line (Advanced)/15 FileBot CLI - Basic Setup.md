FileBot CLI - Basic Setup
=========================

**Important note:** You will need to have Java 1.8 installed locally to use this program - [Java 1.8](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=183)  
  
From the [Filebot FAQ](https://www.filebot.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=7#p7)  
  
**Q:** When I try to start filebot it crashes immediately with an UnsupportedClassVersionError. What does that mean?  
  
**A:** If you get an error like Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: net/filebot/Main : Unsupported major.minor version 52.0 it means that you're running Java 6 or 7 but Java 8 is required for running FileBot.

FileBot CLI - usage
-------------------

  

    ~/filebot/filebot.sh

  

    ~/filebot/bin/filebot.sh -rename "$HOME/path/to/episodes"

  
Use `" "` around paths. Use `$HOME` in paths instead of `~`. Filebot gets confused about the `~`

Your feralhosting.com Account
-----------------------------

  
Let us overview the options available on the feralhosting.com website for managing your slot using the [Account Manager](https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/)  
  
You will be able to access the Manager at all times to overview and manage key aspects of your account and related services. The Account Manager does not run on your Slot's server.

You have a **72 hour** grace period in the event that you forget or cannot to make a payment before the deadline.  
  
**Important note:** You should always open a ticket to warn or inform staff of payment issues, so they can access your situation and help if possible.

This is where you will find important username and password information for the installed services on your slot. This page is always accessible by clicking on the server name of you slot in the Account Overview.

Feral provide all the basic tools you need to get going. This guide will not cover every possible scenario, like using watch folders and RSS. These topics are already covered in the [FAQs](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/) and would only complicate this one.  
  
With these links and with the help of this FAQ you should be downloading in no time at all.  
  

Installing Software
-------------------

  
![](https://raw.github.com/feralhosting/feralfilehosting/master/Feral%20Wiki/General/Your%20Feral%20slot%20is%20active%20-%20Part%201%20-%20The%20Account%20Manager/03%20install%20software%200.png)  
  
Below is a screen-shot of the Software install page. All users with an active slot can access this page via their feralhosting.com manager. This is where you will install the core services provided by Feral as part of the slot packages.  
  
![](https://raw.github.com/feralhosting/feralfilehosting/master/Feral%20Wiki/General/Your%20Feral%20slot%20is%20active%20-%20Part%201%20-%20The%20Account%20Manager/03%20install%20software%201.png)  
  
To install a program you select the radial button next to the application you want and then click on `Install Software` to start the process.  
  
**Important note:** Occasionally the installer does not complete, meaning the "You have requested..." dialogue never gets updated. In this case you can:  
  
**1:** Re install it using the Install software page. This will just restart the process and fixes the issue 99% of the time. This is a common recommendation for troubleshooting installer issues.  
  
If that does not work then:  
  
**2:** Open a  support ticket and use a relevant ticket title. Do not use a title like "HELP!!!" as is not particularly useful to staff in accessing your problems or needs at a glance.  
  
Once you install software from the Manager any relevant information, such as URLs, usernames and passwords will be visible from the [Slot Details](https://www.feralhosting.com/manager/slot/?) page.  
  
![](https://raw.github.com/feralhosting/feralfilehosting/master/Feral%20Wiki/0%20Generic/slot_detail_link.png)  
  
This information should be all you need to access the Web Gui for the selected app/s  
  
**Important Note:** If you have just received your slot, please allow some extra time for things to work, even after the process has shown to be completed.  
  
Remember, you are remotely managing programs on the Feral slot from home or wherever you are. These programs run on the server and not on your laptop or PC. These are the three basic ways in which you will manage the core features of your slot.  
  
- HTTP - Web Gui and more  
- SSH  
- FTP/SFTP  
  
The feralhosting.com  Account Manager is only part of managing your slot. Whilst you have access to some great features directly from the account manager, you will mostly be accessing your slot directly from remote locations using tools like:  
  
- KiTTy for SSH and SSH tunnels  
- FTP/SFTP programs, like Filezilla to download and upload data.  
- Web browsers, like Firefox or Chrome to visit the WebUi for installed programs like ruTorrent or Deluge.  
  
You will use the account manager to access important features like the automatic software installation page for each slot you control and to manage your payments and payment details.  
  
You will use the account manager to access your personal details for the slots features like FTP/SFTP/SSH passwords and WebUi passwords.  
  
And we will cover these topics in part 2 of this article - [Your Feral slot is active - Part 2 - Using your slot](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=225)

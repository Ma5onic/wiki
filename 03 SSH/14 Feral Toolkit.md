from here you can select which menu choice you want to load and then you can run the various scripts found in each menu,  
  
**Important note:** This is a work in progress, iam trying out new things and adding new scripts to the menus over time so that anyone can use this for doing tasks that would take a few minutes now would take a few seconds. if you would like to suggest features you can hit me up on Ferals IRC Chat located on the what-network irc and use \#feral to join feral's channel. or you can hit me up on my Sub Reddit reddit.com/r/feral\_toolkit

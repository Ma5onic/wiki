[Kitty SSH client](http://www.9bis.net/kitty/?page=Download)  
  
[Main Kitty Download Page](http://www.fosshub.com/KiTTY.html)  
  
**Important note:** You can rename `kitty.exe` to `putty.exe` and use it wherever an application has putty integration. For example, Bitkinex and WinSCP.  
  

Information
-----------

  
Completing the whole guide is not Required. To use Kitty to connect to your slot you only need to complete the steps in Part 1 of this FAQ. This will use Kitty to connect in the traditional way you would when using putty.  
  

Part 1: Basic Connection
------------------------

  
We need to force the `UTF-8` language option to avoid some visual issues when connecting. If you are having Unicode character issues it is because you forgot to set this here before connecting.  
  
**1:** Navigate to the `Window` panel.  
  
**2:** Select the `Translation` panel.  
  
**3:** Select `UTF-8` in the drop down menu.

**Important note:** This optional but recommended step will save your Feral username and SSH password for the session to connect without requiring you to enter this information.  
  
**1:** Navigate to the `Connection` panel.  
  
**2:** Select the `Data` panel.  
  
**3:** Enter your Feral username in the `Auto-login username` field.  
  
**4:** Enter your Feral FTP / SFTP / SSH Access password found in the slots details pages for the relevant slot into the `Auto-login password` field.

**1:** Navigate to the `Session` panel if not already there.  
  
**2:** Enter the hostname of the Feral server that hosts your slot.  
  
**3:** The SSH port is always `22`.  
  
**4:** Make sure the `SSH` radio option is selected (it should be selected by default).  
  
**5:** Give this session a name for when we save so you can identify and load it after.  
  
**6:** Save this session with all the information you have provided and settings you have configured.  
  
**Important note:** Make sure you have saved your session once you have provided all the core details.

Once you have saved your  new session then you would normally follow this process when opening KiTTY to work with saved sessions:  
  
**1:** Navigate to the `Session` panel if not already there (this panel is the default when opening KiTTY)  
  
**2:** Select the session you want to load  
  
**3:** Click on `Load` to load this session and all configurations associated with it.  
  
**4:** Click `Open` to start the connection.

**Important note:** Check you are connecting to the right host before accepting. If you connecting to the correct host and are asked to save the HOSTs Key say `yes` and check and box that says to remember/always do this.

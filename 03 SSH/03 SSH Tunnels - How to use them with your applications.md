SSH Tunnels - How to use them with your applications
====================================================

  

### Using SSH Tunnels with your applications:

  
Once you have created and opened your tunnels in your SSH client you need to configure you applications to use them. This guide cannot possibly cover each and every program. Also your program needs to support proxying in some way. This will usually be in the settings or preferences somewhere under the title of `Proxy`  / `Network Settings` / `Connection Settings`. Possibly as a subcategory of a section in the settings or options.  
  
With most programs you can either proxy directly using built in settings or with add-ons or plugins of some type like foxyproxy in Firefox and ProxyOmega in Chrome. We will look at the most common options that will be an applicable template to most other scenarios.

[Proxy SwitchyOmega](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif)

Once you have installed the plugins, click on it's icon and click on `Options` and create a new profile.

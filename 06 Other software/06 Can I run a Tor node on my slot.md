Can I run a Tor node on my slot?
================================

**No**.Â  We do not allow Tor exit nodes to be run on our servers. They're open invitations for trouble, and while Tor serves a useful purpose our network is not the place for it.  
  
Tor relays are fine provided they strictly only act as an intermediary.  
  
We will make an exception to this rule if you bring your own RIPE IPs and handle abuse directly while taking full responsibility.

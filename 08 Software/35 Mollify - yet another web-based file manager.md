    cd ~/www/$(whoami).$(hostname -f)/public_html/

  
2.2: Download and unzip the file using wget and zip via SSH using this command

2.3: Create and open a file called `configuration.php` using this command:  
  

    nano -w mollify/backend/configuration.php

  
For a very simple and fast setup just copy and paste this:  
  

    <?php
    $CONFIGURATION = array(
        "db" => array(
            "type" => "sqlite3",
            "file" => "my.db"
        )
    );
    ?> 

  
Then press and hold `CTRL` and then press `x` to save. Press `y` to confirm.  
  
You are now ready to create an admin account and start using mollify. The wizard can be accessed from the following link:

Installation options.
---------------------

  
**Important note:** There is commas at the end of each line are important in the configuration file and are required except for the last. Make sure each line insdie the `"db" => array( )` is terminated with a  `,` except for the last line. For example:  
  

    "db" => array(
    "type" => "",
    "user" => "",
    "password" => "",
    "table_prefix" => ""
    )

  

### Using mysql:

  
1: It is required you have installed MySQL via your Manager for the relevant slot. Use this FAQ - [Installing Software](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=6)  
  
2: It is suggested you create a limited user following this FAQ [adminer](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=116). This is an optional but recommended step, to create a limited user.  
  
Once you have done both of these steps you can continue to install Mollify using MySQL  
  
1: You will need to change the `SOCKETPATH` with the path to your MySQL socket found on the Slot details page for the relevant slot.  
2: You will need to use a valid MySQL username and replace `USERNAME` with your username.  
3: You will need to use this users' password and replace `PASSWORD` with this users password.  
  

    <?php
    $CONFIGURATION = array(
        "db" => array(
            "type" => "mysql",
            "user" => "USERNAME",
            "password" => "PASSWORD",
            "socket" => "/media/DiskID/home/username/private/mysql/socket",
            "database" => "mollify",
            "table_prefix" => "mollify_",
            "charset" => "utf8"
        )
    );
    ?>

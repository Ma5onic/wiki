Installing Murmur
=================

  

"Magic" Installer
-----------------

  
To install Murmur on your seedbox, you should use this script  
  

    wget -qO ~/install.murmur http://git.io/-mVd3g && bash ~/install.murmur

  
Simply grab the script with wget or curl on your machine, run it, and you'll have Murmur installed at  
  

    ~/murmur/murmurd

  
Once you're done with that, please read the `Configuring Murmur.ini` section.  
  
Note: This script does nothing malicious. If you find a bug, please edit this Wiki page to note it, or message  
  

    zovt

  
on IRC.  
  

Configuring Murmur.ini
----------------------

  
At this point, running  
  

    ~/murmur/murmurd

  
will start murmur and leave you with a working server. However, this will pollute whatever directory you're running it from with log files and database files. If you don't want that, read on.  
  
By default, the above script should have created a file called  
  

    murmur.ini

  
in  
  

    ~/murmur/

  
Fire up your favorite text editor and edit  
  

    ~/murmur/murmur.ini

  
and change the paths on the following lines in the file to whatever you like:  
  

    database=
    logfile=
    pidfile=

  
I personally like just using the murmur folder at /full path to your home dir/murmur  
  

All Done!
---------

  
Now, run murmur with  
  

    ~/murmur/murmurd -ini ~/murmur/murmur.ini

  
connect, and you're good to go!

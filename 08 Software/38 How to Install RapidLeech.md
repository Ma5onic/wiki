How to Install RapidLeech
=========================

  
RapidLeech allows you to download files from file-hosting services such as Rapidshare.com etc. directly on to your Feral slot. You can then FTP them down to your home computer without any timers.  
  
Installation is exceptionally easy — run these two command in [SSH](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12):  
  
The URL is using Rapidleech `rl23_v43_SVN430.zip` from here [Rapid Share Source Code](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2TOwN5xkUeIQ3RxT3c1allQZkE#list)  
  

    wget -qO ~/rapid.zip http://git.io/3nr6fw
    unzip -qn ~/rapid.zip -d ~/www/$(whoami).$(hostname -f)/public_html/

  
Then visit your Feral URL in a web browser, for example:  
  

    http://username.server.feralhosting.com/rapidleech/

  

### Creating your config.php

  
Now, you can set whatever options you need or want then scroll to the bottom and click `Save Configuration` to create your first `config.php`.

Now you can password protect your installation.  
  
You newly created config.php file is located at (relative path to the WWW root):  
  

    /rapidleech/configs/config.php

  
Rapidleech has no password authentication turned on by default, so it is necessary to follow [this Rapidleech Wiki article](http://wiki.rapidleech.com/FAQ#How_to_setup_password_on_rapidleech.3F) to enable it. This is a required step.  
  
**New Password Protection Method:**  
  
**1:** Make sure you have created and saved your `config.php` and shown in the previous step.  
  
**2:** Edit you config.php using nano in SSH using this command:  
  

    nano -w ~/www/$(whoami).$(hostname -f)/public_html/rapidleech/configs/config.php

  
Find the line:  
  

    'login' => false,

  
then replace it with:  
  

    'login' => true,

  
**3:** In the next line, you will see :  
  

    'users' => 
      array (
        'test' => 'test',
      ),

  
**4:** change: `test` to your user name and then the second `test` to your password  
  

    'feral' => 'password',

  
Where feral is your username and password is your password.  
  
**5:** Now, it should look like this :  
  

    'users' => 
      array (
        'feral' => 'password',
      ),

  
Where `feral` is your username and `password` is your password.  
  
**6:** Save this file and your password protection will be active.

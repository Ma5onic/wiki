Python - Usage and Installation
===============================

  
In SSH do the commands described in this FAQ. If you do not know how to SSH into your slot use this FAQ: [SSH basics - Putty](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12)  
  
Your FTP / SFTP / SSH login information can be found on the Slot Details page for the relevant slot. Use this link in your Account Manager to access the relevant slot:

You login information for the relevant slot will be shown here:

**Important Note:** Do not install Python manually without a good reason. It will most likely cause more problems than is solves.  
  
**Python 2.7.9 is already installed on your slot**  
  
Type to show the current version:  
  

    python -V

  
`pip` is installed on all servers ready to be used. You do no need to install `pip` locally first. To use it do this:  
  

    pip install --user modulename

  
For example:  
  

    pip install --user requests

  

Installing Modules locally and/or overriding installed modules
--------------------------------------------------------------

  
This step is required otherwise you'll get an error.  
  

    pip install --user --ignore-installed pip

  
Now you can overwrite modules locally using this command:  
  

    pip install --user --ignore-installed modulename

  

Installing Python locally:
--------------------------

  
You **do not** need to follow this FAQ to use python or python scripts. If you have a missing module you can open a ticket and ask staff to install it or use the above section to install it locally.  
  
This is a basic guide to installing Python to your home directory . You will also be able to use `easy_install` to install mods.  
  

Installing Python 2.7 from source:
----------------------------------

  
In SSH do these commands. Use this FAQ if you do not know how to SSH into your slot: [SSH basics - Putty](https://www.feralhosting.com/faq/view?question=12)  
  
**Important note:** We do not recommend you install directly to `$HOME` or use this installation in the `PATH` over the existing version.  There will be problems if you do. Do something like this instead:  
  

    --prefix=$HOME/python/python.2.7

  

    mkdir -p ~/python/python2
    wget -qO ~/Python.tgz https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/Python-2.7.10.tgz
    tar xf ~/Python.tgz && cd ~/Python-2.7.10
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/python/python2 && make && make install

  
The configuration and installation can take some time to be patient.  
  
When it is finished installing, do some clean up with this command.  
  

    cd && rm -rf ~/Python{-2.7.10,.tgz}

  
Python has been installed. Now check which version is in use:  
  

    ~/python/python2/bin/python -V

  
Using `easy_install` from the command line to install mods:  
  

    ~/python/python2/bin/easy_install pip

  

    ~/python/python2/bin/pip install virtualenv

  

    ~/python/python2/bin/pip install flexget

  

Python 3
--------

  

    mkdir -p ~/python/python3
    wget -qO ~/python.tar.xz  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.0/Python-3.5.0.tar.xz
    tar xf ~/python.tar.xz && cd ~/Python-3.5.0
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/python/python3 && make && make install

  
The configuration and installation can take some time to be patient.  
  
When it is finished installing, do some clean up with this command.  
  

    cd && rm -rf ~/python{-3.5.0,.tar.xz}

  
Python has been installed. Now check which version is in use:  
  

    ~/python/python3/bin/python3 -V

  
Using `easy_install` from the command line to install mods:  
  

    ~/python/python3/bin/pip3 install virtualenv

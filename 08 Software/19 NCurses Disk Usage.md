NCurses Disk Usage
==================

Ncdu is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. It is designed to find space hogs on a remote server where you don't have an entire graphical setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular desktop systems. Ncdu aims to be fast, simple and easy to use, and should be able to run in any minimal POSIX-like environment with ncurses installed.

Automated Install
-----------------

  

    wget -qO ~/ncdu.install http://git.io/vTwuq && bash ~/ncdu.install

  

Manual Install
--------------

  
Check to see if dependencies are installed:  
  

    dpkg -s libncurses5-dev
    dpkg -s libncursesw5-dev

  
If they are not, you will need to open a ticket for them to be installed before you continue.  
sample:  
  

    Please can you install the libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev dependencies for NCDU?

    https://packages.debian.org/en/wheezy/libncurses5-dev
    https://packages.debian.org/en/wheezy/libncursesw5-dev

    apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev

    Thank you.

  
Now install NCurses Disk Usage using these commands:  
  

    wget -qO ~/ncdu-1.11.tar.gz http://dev.yorhel.nl/download/ncdu-1.11.tar.gz
    cd ~/ 
    tar xvzf ncdu-1.11.tar.gz
    cd ncdu-1.11
    ./configure --prefix="$HOME"
    make
    make install
    cd ~/
    rm -r ~/ncdu-1.11*

  
If ~/bin is already in your $PATH, then do this to run NCurses Disk Usage.

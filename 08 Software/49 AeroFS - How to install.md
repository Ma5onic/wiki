Aerofs introduction
-------------------

  
Aerofs is essentially a peer to peer secure dropbox style app. You only share directly with your attached devices.  
  
"AeroFS encrypts your data end-to-end, and only shares your files with those who you invite. Files are never stored in the public cloud."  
  

Install AeroFS:
---------------

  
Please go to <https://aerofs.com/> and create an account.  
  

    wget -qO ~/aerofs.tgz https://dsy5cjk52fz4a.cloudfront.net/aerofs-installer-0.8.91.tgz
    tar xf ~/aerofs.tgz

  

Running Aerofs
--------------

  
At first run we need set up the app and it work better in a screen, so type this command:  
  

    screen -S aerofs ~/aerofs/aerofs-cli

  

### Aerofs Teamserver example (Optional - Just for demonstration):

  
**Important note:** The teamserver installation is pretty much exactly the same. Centralised files storage vs peer to peer clients.  
  

    wget -qO ~/aerofsts.tgz https://dsy5cjk52fz4a.cloudfront.net/aerofsts-installer-0.8.91.tgz
    tar xf ~/aerofsts.tgz
    screen -S aerofs ~/aerofs/aerofsts-cli
